## "A Density Control Algorithm for Doing Insertions and Deletions in a Sequentially Ordered File inn a Good Worst-Case Time"

> Consider a file which arranges records in sequential order, and stores them with
> possible empty spaces in M consecutive pages of memory. We develop an insertion/deletion
> algorithm which runs in a worst-case time approximately proportional to
> log^2(M) divided by the page-size when the set of manipulated records has cardinality
> O(M).
